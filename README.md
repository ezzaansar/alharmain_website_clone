# Alharmain website clone

This project contains images that could not be uploaded to GitHub due to file size limitations.

## 📦 Image Files
Some of the required image assets are larger than GitHub’s storage limit (25MB for normal files and 100MB per file without Git LFS).  
Therefore, they are not included in this repository.

## 🔗 Download Images
You can download all the images from the following link:  
[Download Images from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BRCzpBc2wru50GNR9_egWmBAQpIm2Cht?usp=drive_link)

## 📝 Notes
- Place the downloaded images in the `images/` folder of the project before running it.
- The images are not modified and are exactly as intended for the project.

⚠ **Reason for Exclusion:**  
GitHub restricts pushing files larger than 100MB and large collections of files can quickly exceed repo size limits. To keep the repository lightweight and avoid storage issues, images are hosted externally.
